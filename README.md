# C.A.B.A.L: Computer Assited Biological Artificial Lifeform

### It's about f**king time!!

Welcome to the CABAL project! This repository is dedicated to recreating the iconic artificial intelligence from the Command & Conquer universe. My goal is to build a simulated version of CABAL with enhanced functionality, including speech synthesis, decision-making, and strategic capabilities. And organic components.

### üöÄ Project Overview

CABAL is a highly intelligent, self-aware supercomputer with a strong presence in the *Command & Conquer* series, serving as the primary antagonist of the Brotherhood of Nod. In this project, we aim to develop a system that replicates CABAL's capabilities, including its:

- **Speech generation** (using a synthesized mechanical voice).
- **Strategic thinking** and decision-making.
- **Self-awareness** with an evolving state based on interactions.

This project is designed to explore AI capabilities, specifically focusing on creating a virtual entity that mimics CABAL‚Äôs unique features in the Command & Conquer universe.

### üß† Features

- **Speech Synthesis**: Using an AI-based speech engine to replicate CABAL‚Äôs iconic voice.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Simulating CABAL's strategic and tactical decision-making abilities.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing self-improvement mechanisms for CABAL to adapt to new situations.
- **Interactive Command Interface**: Allowing users to interact with CABAL in a conversational format.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cabal-ai.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python cabal_ai.py
    ```

### üß™ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `nltk` for natural language processing
- `pyttsx3` or another speech synthesis library for voice generation
- Custom models for decision-making and AI behavior

### üìù How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.

We welcome contributions that enhance the CABAL AI experience! Please ensure that any additions maintain the integrity of CABAL‚Äôs character and design.

### üß© Roadmap

- [ ] **Basic CABAL Interface**: Create an initial system for receiving and processing commands.
- [ ] **Voice Synthesis**: Implement realistic speech synthesis with a mechanical tone.
- [ ] **AI Decision-Making**: Develop a system for strategic and tactical thinking.
- [ ] **Self-Improvement Algorithms**: Allow CABAL to adapt and learn from user input.
- [ ] **Expand Knowledge Base**: Integrate a vast library of commands and responses to simulate CABAL‚Äôs intellect.
